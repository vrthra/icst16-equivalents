Although our experiments were designed to measure ectiveness, we also observed that using
these criteria, particularly mutation testing, was costly. Even for these small subject programs, the
human effort needed to check a large number of mutants for equivalence was almost prohibitive

X. Cai and M. R. Lyu. The effect of code coverage on fault detection under different testing profiles. In International Workshop on Advances in Model-Based Testing, pages 1–7, 2005
 investigated the correlation between different coverage criteria—branch coverage, decision cover- age, P-use, and C-use—and fault detection, using a linear regression model
 Their results showed that coverage criteria were only a moderate indicator for fault detection, with large variance for different test suites.
